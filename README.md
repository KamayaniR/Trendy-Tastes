# Trendy Tastes: Identifying and Visualising Evolving Customer Preferences Using Yelp Reviews

## Executive Summary
  This project aims to extract actionable insights from Yelp reviews to help businesses adapt to evolving customer preferences in the food and hospitality sector. We identify shifting 
  demands around food, ambience, and service quality by applying sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and trend detection techniques. Our goal is to guide restaurants and marketers in 
  realigning their offerings and strategies with real-time customer expectations.
  
## Problem Statement
Customer preferences change rapidly in the food and hospitality industry, but businesses often lack tools to monitor these shifts proactively. This results in missed opportunities to meet current market demands.

## Key Questions:
- What are customers currently saying about food, ambience, and service?
- How have preferences changed over time in specific geographies?
- Can businesses use these insights to adjust menus, renovate spaces, or tailor marketing?
